      <h1>Amit Agarwal: India’s First Professional Blogger and the Mind Behind Labnol</h1>
      <div class="meta">Published: September 23, 2025</div>

      <p>When people talk about the rise of professional blogging in India, one name stands out — Amit Agarwal, the founder of Digital Inspiration (Labnol). Often called India’s first professional blogger, Amit turned his passion for technology into a global one-man business that inspires millions.</p>

      <p>Amit hails from Uttar Pradesh and comes from a business family. After completing his Computer Science degree from IIT Roorkee in 1999, he worked in Hyderabad before returning to Agra to pursue blogging full-time in 2004. His very first blog post? A review of his newly purchased printer. That small beginning eventually sparked what many describe as the Indian blogging revolution.</p>

      <p>Over the years, Amit has received numerous recognitions, including Google Developer Expert, Google Cloud Champion Innovator, and Microsoft MVP (five years in a row). Media houses such as CNN IBN, BBC Radio, CNBC, and NDTV have featured his work, while The Economic Times called him an out-of-the-box thinker.</p>

      <p>Though widely admired as a blogger, Amit prefers to call himself a software developer and problem-solver. In fact, his biggest earnings don’t come from ads on Labnol but from the productivity tools and Google Workspace add-ons he created — like Mail Merge for Gmail and Document Studio. These tools are used by millions worldwide, including organizations such as Airbus, LinkedIn, and even the U.S. Embassy. His blog mainly serves as a platform to build trust and reach users for these products.</p>

      <p>The journey hasn’t been without challenges. In 2012, his websites were hacked and deleted entirely — a major setback for any solo entrepreneur. Yet, Amit bounced back quickly, proving his resilience and commitment to data security.</p>

      <p>Today, Labnol is more than just a blog; it’s a testament to how one person, armed with knowledge and persistence, can create a global, profitable tech business from scratch. Amit Agarwal’s story continues to inspire creators, developers, and entrepreneurs across the world.</p>
