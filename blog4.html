      <h2>FireLens (Fire-Boltt): From Smartwatches to AI Eyewear — A New Chapter in Wearables</h2>

      <h3>Genesis & Founders’ Backstory</h3>
      <p>Fire-Boltt began as a wearable tech company in India, focusing initially on smartwatches, fitness wearables, and audio accessories. The company was co-founded by <strong>Arnav Kishore</strong> and his sister <strong>Aayushi Kishore</strong>. Arnav often plays the public role of CEO and brand face, while Aayushi has been involved in operations, product strategy, and design orientation.</p>

      <p>Their entrepreneurial instincts run in the family — their father was also an entrepreneur in the sports product industry. Their early experiments, such as smart shoes for tracking vitals, shaped their approach to hardware + software integration. Their positioning was clear from the start: offer global-level wearable specs at affordable prices for Indian and similar markets.</p>

      <h3>Education & Background</h3>
      <p>Aayushi holds a Master’s in Economics from Delhi University and an Executive MBA from Harvard Business School. Arnav attended Pathways World School before diving into entrepreneurship. Their exposure to family business helped form their early mindset.</p>

      <h3>Evolution into Smart Eyewear — FireLens</h3>
      <p>In September 2025, Fire-Boltt launched <strong>FireLens</strong>, India’s first AI-powered smart eyewear line. The product lineup includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>FireLens Audio</strong> — converts normal glasses into audio glasses with speakers and mic for calls and music.</li>
        <li><strong>FireLens Vision AI</strong> — more advanced with 8MP smart camera, dual AI engines, real-time translation, contextual queries, memory recall, and styling suggestions.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Key features include 32GB storage, ~40 hours standby battery, voice-command photo/video capture, real-time translation in 32+ languages, and object recognition. FireLens is designed with multiple frame styles, prescription-ready lenses, and fashion aesthetics in mind.</p>

      <h3>Growth, Position & Challenges</h3>
      <p>Fire-Boltt already has a strong foothold in India’s wearable market, claiming revenue of ~₹500 crore in FY22. They’ve expanded aggressively with millions of smartwatch sales. FireLens represents their ambition to move beyond wrist wearables into a premium, tech-first eyewear category, priced between ₹9,999–₹14,999.</p>

      <p>Challenges include power/battery limits, privacy concerns, real-world AI performance, user adoption, and after-sales support.</p>

      <h3>Outlook & Significance</h3>
      <p>The FireLens launch signals Fire-Boltt’s ambition to evolve into a holistic wearable tech company. The founders see this as a shift from screen-based interaction to ambient, hands-free AI-driven interfaces. If successful, FireLens could position India as not just a market consumer but a global innovator in wearables.</p>
