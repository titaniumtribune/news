        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer just a futuristic concept. It is embedded in our daily routines — from smart assistants like Siri and Alexa to recommendation systems on Netflix and Spotify. AI is transforming industries such as healthcare, finance, education, and transportation.</p>
        <p>In healthcare, AI helps doctors analyze patient data faster and more accurately. In finance, it powers fraud detection and smart trading. Education is also evolving with AI-driven personalized learning tools. Self-driving cars are becoming a reality thanks to AI algorithms.</p>
        <p>As AI continues to grow, it’s important to embrace its benefits while being mindful of its challenges.</p>
